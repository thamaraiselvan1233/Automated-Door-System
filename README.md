 
### Internship Week-1 Task

---

## Internship Details
This project was completed as part of the *Week-1 task of the Embedded Systems Internship* at  
*Sarvagna Innovation Private Limited*.

---

📌 Project Title
*Automated Door System using Arduino (Simulation Based)*

---

## Objective
The objective of this project is to design and simulate an automated door system using Arduino.  
The system automatically opens and closes the door based on motion detection, demonstrating the fundamentals of automation and embedded systems.

---

## Tools & Software Used
- Arduino Uno  
- PIR / IR Sensor  
- LED (door status indicator)  
- Wokwi Simulator  
- Arduino IDE (logic reference)

---

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno  
- PIR Sensor  
- LED  
- Jumper Wires  

---

## Working Principle
- The sensor continuously monitors for human presence.  
- When motion is detected, a digital signal is sent to the Arduino.  
- The Arduino processes the signal and turns ON the LED, representing door opening.  
- When no motion is detected, the LED is turned OFF, representing door closing.

---

## Circuit Explanation
- PIR sensor output pin is connected to *digital pin 7* of the Arduino.  
- LED is connected to *digital pin 13* and GND.  
- Power is supplied using Arduino *5V and GND* pins.  
- The circuit is designed and tested using the *Wokwi simulation platform*.

---

## Code Explanation
- The Arduino program reads digital input from the PIR sensor.  
- If the sensor output is *HIGH*, the LED turns ON.  
- If the sensor output is *LOW*, the LED turns OFF.  

This logic simulates the automatic opening and closing of the door.

---

## Output
- Motion detected → LED ON → Door Open  
- No motion → LED OFF → Door Close  

---

## Result
The automated door system works correctly in simulation.  
The project successfully demonstrates sensor interfacing, digital input/output control, and basic automation concepts.

---

## Conclusion
This project provided hands-on experience with Arduino programming, sensor-based automation, and embedded system fundamentals.  
It helped in understanding real-time control logic through simulation.
